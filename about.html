			<h2>Hello there!</h2> 
					
			<p>My name is Anita; some people call me Annie.</p>  
						
			<p>I am currently studying Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p>
			
			<p>I've always enjoyed art, design and everything related. I can see beauty, design, art, and/or artistic qualities in almost anything.</p>
			
			<p>It is my passion and lifestyle.</p>
			
			<p>However, it took time to come to the realization that I wanted and needed a career in art and design.</p>
			
			<p>Society has told us that a career in these fields is not one that will allow for a stable and successful living — minus some exceptions. With this in mind, I didn't know <em>what I wanted to be when I grew up</em> or <em>what I wanted to do for the rest of my life</em>, unlike everyone around me.</p>
						
			<p>In highschool, I didn't know what I wanted to take in post-secondary school, so I took a variety of courses to keep my options open.</p>
			
			<p>I took all of the Sciences, almost all of the Mathematics, and of course, I tried to take as many Arts courses as I could. Dance, Music, and Drama are considered Arts, but the ones I'm referring to are Visual Arts, Media Arts, and Computer Arts. I was also fortunate enough to take Communication Technology courses, which I've realized is very similar to Graphic Design, if not the same.</p>
			
			<p>Design is often overlooked — in an under-appreciated sense. I overlooked design in not realizing its potential as the perfect career direction for myself. Now I know it is my passion.</p>
						
			<p>Share what <em>your</em> passion is with me and I will use my passion and skills to inspire others to be just as passionate about your interests as you are.</p>
			
			<h3>Whether you need photographs taken, posters designed, websites created, or just want to make an object look beautiful instead of boring, I will meet — and try to exceed — your needs and standards.</h3>
